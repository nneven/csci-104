### Disputes

If you wish to dispute any matters regarding your score on this assignment, please submit a regrade request using this [form](https://forms.gle/TwpvvTuPVS4gTZe57). Any and all discussions pertaining to your homework score **must** be done via comments on this issue once a grader has been assigned to your case.  Do not use email to discuss grading matters as they won't be considered part of the regrade process.

You have 7 days from the time this issue was posted to *raise* a dispute about any grading issues. Allow up to 48 hours for your grader to respond. If your grader cannot resolve the issue within 7 days, you must elevate the issue to one of the TAs by attending their office hours. If after an additional 7 days you are still unhappy with the grading result, you must elevate the issue to Professor Redekopp within 3 days. Your professor will have the final input. 

This means you have a maximum of 7 + 7 + 3 days to resolve all grading disputes, after which point all grades are final. 

You are expected to follow the _Grading Disputes_ policies outlined on the [assignments](http://bytes.usc.edu/cs104/assignments) page.
